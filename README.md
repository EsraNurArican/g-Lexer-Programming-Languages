# gpp-Lexer-Programming-Languages

This repository includes files about implementation of g++ language lexer in two different ways. One is written in lisp and other one is written in c programmin language.
To run the lisp lexer you should write  "clisp gpp_lexer.lisp" to your terminal.
If you want to run lexer written in c, you should run the makefile on your terminal.

Both parts takes an input file name as an optional parameter. If no input file is given, program starts by taking inputs from user.
